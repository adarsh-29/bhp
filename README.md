mlproject
this is a demo projects which can predect the price of homes in Bengaluru.
This includes a pythone flask server(in directry Server) in which I have put a machin learning model (using linear regression) and trained that model on a dataset available on kaggle.com.
Then in Client_android_app includes an android app which makes call to apis from python flask server to predect home price.
Note-In order to run the apis in android. We need to hoste the server ( can be done easily on AWS).
